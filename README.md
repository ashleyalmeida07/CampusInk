# CampusLink

CampusLink is a dynamic, full-stack academic platform designed to seamlessly connect students, faculty, and campus activities. It serves as a centralized portal for managing academic events, forums, study resources, and real-time communication within educational institutions.

- Study material sharing for easy collaboration.
- Discussion forums and group chats to boost interaction.
- A mobile-first, responsive interface with Dark/Light mode options.

CampusLink empowers students to stay updated, organized, and actively involved in campus life, while providing faculty with tools to better coordinate academic initiatives.
